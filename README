this is an example of how to use Apache-Test to
test and deploy Apache C extension modules.

this example assumes that you already have installed
Apache-Test and Test-Simple, as well as a working
Apache 1.3.X installation with mod_so.c available.

mod_images_never_expire is taken from Michael Radwin's
ApacheCon 2004 talk "HTTP Caching and Cache-busting for
for Content Publishers" which is available from:

  http://www.radwin.org/michael/talks/http-caching.ppt

to get started, try this:

  $ export APACHE_TEST_APXS=/path/to/your/bin/apxs
  $ make
  $ make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

to install the module, just

  $ sudo make install
